	<h1>Save Giant Pandas</h1>
</div>
<div class="intro">
<p> Welcome to my website!! This website introduces how Giant Panda lives in nature and why are they hard to survive, etc.</p></div>
<div class="fact">
<h1>Facts</h1></div>
<!-- This is a paragrah -->
<p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.</p>

<!-- This is a paragrah -->
<p> Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
<div class="why">
<h1>
	Why Are Giant Pandas Important?
</h1></div>
<!-- This is a paragrah -->
<p>Cute, often comical, and always charismatic, giant pandas are often the first animal to spark a passion for wildlife conservation and habitat protection. Conserving pandas help safeguard the broader environment, which many people and animals depend on. The panda's habit is important for the livelihoods of local communities, who use it for food, income, fuel for cooking and heating, and medicine.</p>
<!-- This is a paragrah -->
<p>Pandas also play an important role in spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow in China's forests. Many other endangered animals share the panda's forest habitat, including the golden snub-nosed monkey, takin, and crested ibis. So, by saving pandas, we will also be saving other important species and helping to protect the unique forests they live in.</p>

<div class="threats">

	Threats
</h1>
</div>
<!-- This is a paragrah -->
<p>Despite the conservation success in the panda's habitat in recent years, pandas are still at risk. Major contributing factors that limit the panda's recovery are habitat loss and fragmentation as forests are converted to agricultural areas, bamboo is harvested, and large-scale development activities such as road construction, hydropower development, and mining increase.</p>

<p>Because of China's dense and growing human population, many panda populations are isolated in narrow belts of bamboo no more than 1.2 km wide, and panda habitat is continuing to disappear as settlers push higher up the mountain slopes. Pandas are also occasionally caught in snares set for other animals.</p>
