<h1>Graph Theory</h1>
<div class="animation"></div>
<h2>What is graph theory?</h2>
<p style="color: #001858;">Graph theory is the study of relationships. Given a set of nodes and connections, which can abstract anything from city layouts to computer data, graph theory provides a helpful tool to quantify and simplify the many moving parts of dynamic systems.</p>
</div>

<h2>Type of Graphs</h2>
<!-- This class "box1" is used to rest of the code for making the fancy box -->
<div class="box1">
	
	<h3>Tree Graph</h3>
	<p>In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- this class later used for making the box -->
<div class="box1">
	<h3>Star Topology</h3>
	<p>A star topology is a network configuration in which all nodes are connected to a central node called the "hub." The hub acts as a central point of communication, and all other nodes in the network are connected directly to the hub.</p>
	<img src="star.png">
	</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="box1">
	<h3>Ring Topology</h3>
	<p>A ring topology is a network configuration in which the nodes are connected in a closed loop or ring formation. Each node in the network is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a circular structure. In a ring graph, data travels in only one direction around the ring.</p>

	</div>
	<br>
	<br> <!-- line break -->
	<br>
<div class="box1">
	<h3>Bus Topology</h3>
	<p>
Bus topology is a network configuration in which all devices are connected to a single communication pathway called a "bus." In this topology, each device is directly connected to the bus, and data is transmitted along the bus to all devices connected to it.</p>
	<img src="bus.png">
	</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="box1">
	<h3>Fully Connected Topology</h3>
	<p>In a fully connected topology,every node in the network is directly connected to every other node. It is a network configuration where there is a direct link or communication channel between every pair of nodes.</p>
	<img src="fully.png">
	</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="box1">
	<h3>Mesh Topology</h3>
	<p>Mesh topology is a network configuration where devices are interconnected with multiple direct links, forming a network in which every node has a direct connection to every other node. In a mesh network, each device can communicate with any other device directly, without relying on intermediate nodes.</p>
