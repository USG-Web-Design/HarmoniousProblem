 	<!-- paragprah about the Chihuly Garden and Glass -->
 	<p>Dale Chihuly may be the Pacific Northwest’s most famous glass artist. His fanciful glass creations have been exhibited at more than 200 museums, gardens and other venues around the world. <br>Closer to home, the Seattle area celebrates the Tacoma-born artist’s work at Chihuly Garden and Glass, where radiant red and gleaming gold “plants” sparkle in the outdoor gardens, and several indoor galleries showcase Chihuly’s dramatic glass inventions.<br></p>
