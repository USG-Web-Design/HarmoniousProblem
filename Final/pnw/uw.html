        <p class="color2">Suzzallo Library is the central library of the University of Washington in Seattle, and perhaps the most recognizable building on campus. It is named for Henry Suzzallo, who was president of the University of Washington until he stepped down in 1926, the same year the first phase of the library's construction was completed. The library was renamed for him after his death in 1933. </p>

In late 1964, the University transplanted the trees to their current spot, bringing thousands of visitors to campus each spring to witness their rosy bloom.</p>
